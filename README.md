# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating dynamic maps using GeoJSON data. 

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to pull earthquake data from Mapbox's API and visualize the occurances using Leaflet.js.  

## Resources
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, VS Code
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)

## The Map
The [final product](https://github.com/agregorash/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge) combines all previous steps.  All earthquakes are mapped, with plot sizes and coloring corresponding to magnitude, along with fault lines.  Users can toggle between three different map options; 'Streets,' 'Satellite,' or 'Dark.'  Users can also choose which data they wish to see; 'All Earthquakes,' 'Major Earthquakes,' and 'Tectonic Plates.'
